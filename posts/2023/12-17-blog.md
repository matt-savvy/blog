# Building This Blog

## There are a lot of options in 2023

### Getting Started

Just following along with [Crafting your own Static Site Generator using Phoenix](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/crafting-your-own-static-site-generator-using-phoenix/)

```
9c01e5e Initial commit
fa01a71 Create new mix project
79f8c05 Add nimble_publisher
a1aeb8a Add Post
d39a357 Update Blog, use NimblePublisher
7fbdf8d Add Site
080c0f7 Add Build mix task
```

### Refactoring to use heex templates

I'd rather have my templates in files like `index.html.heex` than in a function in my `Site` module.

```
91436f1 Update Site.render_file, use Template
c870efc Update Site, move mkdir output into build
957600b Update Site, use html.heex templates
a1fab37 Update Site, simplify build
60a0429 Update Site, use layout
```

## Tailwind Support

Going back to the steps offered by the article, I tried adding some tailwind support.

```
f2d6bce Add tailwind support
6a14255 Update tailwind config, bump version
```

But tailwind doesn't seem to play nice with the code blocks provided by `makeup`, and I don't know exactly how I would go about adding any more styles in to the html generated from my markdown files.
For now, tailwind is a bust.

```
19a8827 Remove tailwind
```

## `makeup` and syntax highlighting

```
37ff9d3 Update Blog, add more makeup highlighters
27cea99 Update Blog, add earmark_options
1f7853f Add generate_makeup_stylesheet
```

## QOL - file watcher

I'm sure there's a better way to handle live reloading, but right now, IDGAF.
Copy and tweak a watcher script from another project of mine.

```
2d24792 Add watcher.sh
```

We had to set the permissions, but this was kind of nice becuase this is one of the first times I've ever actually remembered the syntax here.

```
$ chmod u+x watcher.sh
```

This will rebuild automatically every time we change our code or our posts.

```
$ ./watcher.sh
./posts/2023/ MODIFY 12-17-blog.md
Compiling 1 file (.ex)
BUILT in 16.638ms
```

## What's Next?

- deciding where to host this
- actually adding some style sheets
- adding the normal contact info, "about me", links to GH, etc
- GHA to build and upload via FTP
- support for images and other static assets
