Here's some text in alternating case:

> mOnGoDb iS WeBsCaLe!

Put your cursor on "this" and use ciw to change inside the word to "it"

---> Why do this?

Put your cursor on "would" and use daw to delete a word. Hit "." to repeat.

---> Why would you want to do this?
     Why do this?

Put your cursor on the second sentence and use cas to change the entire sentence.

---> Why do this? Well, there are a few reasons. When someone writes something ...
     Why do this? I can tell you. When someone writes something ...

Or just use dap to delete the enitre paragraph.

--> Why to do this? Well, there are a few reasons. When someone
writes something that you think is ridiculous, you might want to repeat it back
to them in this text style to mock them.
